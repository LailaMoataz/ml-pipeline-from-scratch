# ML Pipeline From Scratch

This project demonstrates a simple, clean machine learning pipeline
with proper structure and evaluation.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn

## Status
Work in progress

## Design Decisions

- Used a pipeline to prevent data leakage between training and testing
- Included feature scaling as part of the training process
- Chose Logistic Regression for interpretability and simplicity

## Possible Improvements

- Add cross-validation
- Save trained model to disk
- Add hyperparameter tuning

## Notes

This project focuses on structure and best practices rather than model complexity.
